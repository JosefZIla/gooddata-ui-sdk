# SDK End-to-end tests

This project contains End-to-End tests for GoodData.UI components.

## Overview

Tests in this library verify various go-through scenarios for GoodData.UI components. Tests are implemented using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

## DEV Guide

### Running tests locally

-   Make sure, that application in scenarios folder is built.
-   Run script `run-isolated-local`. The script prepares docker instances with needed volumes and runs the tests on the scenarios application.

### Adding new test

-   In folder `cypres/integration` you can either create new folder for the tests you're writing. You can then add new `*.spec.ts` file into either this new folder or to suitable existing one.
-   In the `scenarios/src/components/Scenarios`, create new Scenario file and within the new file use the component you are about to test.
-   In the `scenarios/src/routes/ComponentResolver`, add the `ScenarioComponent` you just created with a new unique hash. Navigation component takes this hash as its parameter and navigates the application to matching component.
