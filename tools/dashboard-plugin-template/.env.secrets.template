## Authentication setup when developing plugins against GoodData Platform
##
## Note: this setup is only used by the development harness. Plugins deployed to production rely on the context
## to set up the security context. Additionally, you may keep this file free of any secrets and set the credentials
## or tokens in your session instead.
##
## !!! IMPORTANT: if you add any credentials or tokens into this file, make sure to never commit to VCS. The file is
## !!!            added in .gitignore by default and should stay there.
